# SubToken - Subscription-Based Access Token

## Project Description
SubToken allows users to subscribe to a digital service by locking Ether into a smart contract, which gives them temporary access based on the number of months paid.

## Project Vision
To create a decentralized, censorship-resistant way of managing subscriptions without platform dependence or third-party processors.

## Key Features
- Monthly subscriptions using Ether
- Auto-extension of expiry on repeated payments
- Public access check to validate user status

## Future Scope
- Tiered subscription models
- Integration with ERC-20 tokens
- On-chain alerts and subscription reminders
